# Unifying Public Datasets for Insulator Detection and Fault Classification in Electrical Power Lines

Data of the merged two public isolator detasets available with the code to merge then.

## Data
If you just want to use the data generated by this work, download the images and labels (in COCO format) available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1829TgSKUVGZXk4_cd1BKtK0L9XHkHA4j?usp=sharing).

## Installation
All code was tested using Python 3.7

We use the Albumentations API to perform data augmentation.  
The API is available [here](https://github.com/albumentations-team/albumentations). Use the Albumentation instruction to install then.

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the requirements.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To do the merge and increase the data of this work, it is necessary to download the file downsized.zip of the dataset proposed by Tomaszewski et al. available [here](https://cv.po.opole.pl/dataset1/) and copy the content to the Tomaszewski folder. Do the same for the CPLID dataset available [here](https://github.com/InsulatorData/InsulatorDataSet) and copying its contents to the CPLID folder.

Copy the contents of the 'albumentations' folder to the folder where the Albumentations project was cloned.

## Usage

Change the "data_root" file path from data_augmentation.py file to the path that you cloned this project and run with Python in Albumentation project folder:


```python
python data_augmentation.py
```
